## Installation instructions

1) Download and install [Project Babble](https://github.com/SummerSigh/ProjectBabble)
   and [VRCFaceTracking](https://github.com/TigersUniverse/VRCFaceTracking)
2) Download a copy of the latest release [here](https://github.com/Slime-Senpai/VRCFT-Babble/releases/latest)
3) Drop the `VRCFaceTracking.Babble.dll` file in `AppData\Roaming\VRCFaceTracking\CustomLibs`. If this folder does not
   exist you can create it, VRCFaceTracking will create it on launch
4) Launch Project Babble, and set your outgoing port to 8888. You can do this via the GUI, or by editing the Python
   script directly. Also, be sure to orient your camera properly so your expressions aren't flipped in-game
5) Launch VRCFT (v5!)
6) Enable OSC in your Unity project (or in ChilloutVR via a mod)
7) Equip a face-tracking avatar (one with unified expressions)
8) Profit!
